Pointer Arithmetic
---------------------
int *a;        a++;    1000 + 1 -> 1004
char *b;       b++;    1000 + 1 -> 1001
short *c;      c++;    1000 + 1 -> 1002
double *d;     d++;    1000 + 1 -> 1008
when a pointer has 1 added to it, it moves by the size of the type

float f = 3.14159, *fptr = &f;
float *fptr2 = fptr + 3;

cout << (long) fptr2 - (long) fptr << endl;
cout << fptr2 - fptr << endl;

prints: "
  12
  3
"
