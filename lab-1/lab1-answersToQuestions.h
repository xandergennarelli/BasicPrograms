 * Lab 1
 *
 * 1. What are differences between the original value and the incremented value?
 *    intPtr increases by 4 bytes, chPtr increases by 1 bytes, dblPtr increases by 2 bytes
 *
 * 2. Is this what you expected?
 *    no
 *
 * 3. Provide an explanation of the results.
 *    Well I thought incrementing a pointer increased its position by the sizeof
 *    the type, but a doubles size is 8 bytes so im not sure what happened.
 *
 * 4. Explain the difference between *, &, and just the variableâ€™s name.
 *    * allows you to access the value a pointer is pointing to, & gives you the
 *    address a certain value is stored, and the variable name allows you to access
 *    the value of that variable but not the address.
